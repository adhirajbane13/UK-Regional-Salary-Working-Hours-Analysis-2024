# UK Regional Salary Working Hours Analysis 2024
 This project explores regional salary disparities and working hours trends across the UK using data from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE). The goal is to analyze whether longer working hours lead to higher salaries and identify key economic patterns across different regions.  The Tableau dashboard visualizes median annual earnings and mean working hours across various UK regions. It highlights the highest- and lowest-paying areas and examines potential correlations between salary levels and work hours. The findings indicate no strong relationship between longer working hours and higher salaries, suggesting that regional industry composition and economic factors play a larger role in wage differences.  The analysis reveals that the West of England, with a median salary of £34,491, has the highest earnings, while Tees Valley records the lowest at £27,423. Despite these wage differences, regions with lower salaries, such as the North East and Tees Valley, work similar hours to higher-paying regions. This suggests that wage disparities are more influenced by industry presence and economic strength than by working hours.  The dataset was preprocessed using Excel and Python (Pandas) before being visualized in Tableau Public. The final dashboard provides an interactive exploration of salary trends and labor patterns across the UK.
